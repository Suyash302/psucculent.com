        <h2>About</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>In botany, succulent plants, also known as succulents, are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged, usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. It is a characteristic that is not used scientifically for the definition of most families and genera of plants because it often can be used as an accurate characteristic only at the single species level. The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning 'juice', or 'sap'. Succulent plants may store water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. The water content of some succulent organs can get up to 90â€“95%. Some definitions also include roots, thus geophytes that survive unfavorable periods by dying back to underground storage organs may be regarded as succulents. In horticultural use, the term succulent is sometimes used in a way that excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti. Succulents are often grown as ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual appearance, as well as their ability to thrive with relatively minimal care.

Many plant families have multiple succulents species found within them (more than 25 plant families).[3] In some families, such as Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, and Crassulaceae, most species are succulents. The habitats of these water-preserving plants are often in areas with high temperatures and low rainfall, such as deserts. Succulents have the ability to thrive on limited water sources, such as mist and dew, which makes them equipped to survive in an ecosystem that contains scarce water sources.<br></p>

Anyone who has observed the trailing rickrack patterned leaves of the Epiphyllum anguliger plant will find beauty in the foliage alone, but the fantastic orchid-like flowers that sometimes appear are the icing on the cake. Unlike some succulents, the fishbone cactus appreciates a humid environment. However, the plants get by on partial sunlight or filtered light. The trailing habit of the fishbone cactus makes it ideal for hanging baskets or a sturdy container on a pedestal.

The large, overlapping leaves of Crassula perfoliata are a striking feature of this 2-foot tall native of South Africa. If you give your propeller plant an outdoor vacation in bright sunlight in the summer, you might coax the plant into producing its long-lasting bright red flower clusters, which resemble those of the penta plant. Sharp drainage is essential for this succulent, which can suffer from fungus in damp conditions.
